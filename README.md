#School Data Dashboard  
This is a School Data Dashboard that shows the latest assessment information for (a fictional) school,
Grange Hill Primary School. The information enables the school to analyse the achievement of the students across
the range of core subjects (Reading, Writing and Mathematics) and compare different groups using context filters.

The assessment information can be filtered by cohort, using the selector, so that appropriate resources can be targeted to 
raise achievement where the greatest support is needed.

The average graphs, in section 3, enable the school to compare the overall attainment in each cohort by subject.

##UX
#User Stories
As a teacher I can analyse the performance my cohort so that I am able to identify strengths and areas to focus my teaching
interventions and which subject to develop my skills in.

Ad a school leader I can compare the performance of cohorts using the selector tool or comparing averages 
so that I can target school resources for maximum proogress in student's outcomes.

As a school leader I can view the whole school performance so that I can analyse the effectiveness of school strategies 
and adapt accordingly. 

As the school's special educational needs coordinator and I can analyse the performance of children with special needs and
compare to children who do not have special needs so that I know how to target my staff resources.

As the school's English Subject Leader I can see how well students are performing in reading and writing and see which cohorts 
or teachers may need great support or training.

As a consultant (or inspector) I can analyse the performance of 'Pupil Premium' children to see how well the school is supporting
students who are disadvantaged and see how well the school is spending its 'Pupil Premium' funding. This is so that I can provide 
guidance to the school.


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

##Features

#Feature 1 - Cohort Selector
This allows all users to select a specific cohort by using the dropdown menu.

#Feature 2 - Context Filters
This allows users to analyse the context of the school (eg how many boys compared to girls) and then filter
by clicking on the chart segments to compare data with regars to that specific selection.

#Feature 3 - Subject Attainment Spread
This allows users to analyse the attainment spread of students for each subject. Results can be filtered by cohort using 
the selector (above) or by clicking one of the chart segments to filter further still. The latter enbales users to see
how well students perform across more than one subbject.

#Feature 4 - Cohort Average Comparisons
This allows school leaders to compare cohorts by average attainment (based on 2 being equal to the minimum expectation). You can click on the bars or use 
selector to filter by cohort.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
